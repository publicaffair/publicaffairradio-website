			<h2>About the project</h2>
			<p>Public affair is a non-commercial webradio from Aarhus. </p>
			<p>Between April 2021 - April 2023, we curated monthly radio shows by emerging and established musicians, DJs and artists as well as music enthusiasts without any professional ambitions. </p>
			<p>The vision is to establish a platform from and for the local community, which promotes collaboration and cultural expression through music and dialogues. </p>
			<p>Sharing the love for our neighbourhood and our love for music, this non-profit project is for all of those, who want to get involved - without any borders. </p>
			<p>We encourage all radio contributors to play and curate music, that each one truly dig themselves. As long as selections come from heart, all styles and tastes share the same space on this platform. </p>
